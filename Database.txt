//Database -- SQL query preperation

***** Why Database not EXCEl--i) One is security reason, Limited data is stored in excel .

Database-- It stores data in an organozed form. Database is just a file.Database consist of one or more table

Database Management system:-  It is a program that manages database file.
                            For example:- MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL.. so on

SQL(structured Query Language) - It is an official language of DataBase.

RDBMS- Data are organized in the form of rows and columns.




************* SQL Ouery***************

To create Database:-
    CREATE Database <Database-Name>;
for example create database for our college--------- CREATE Database college;

**************
To Delete Database:-
     DROP Database <Database-name>;
for example Delete Database of college ------------ DROP Database college;
**************
To Create Table
     CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
   //column_name data_type;
//column_name data_type;
//column_name data_type;
);

For example:   
CREATE TABLE student(
id int,
name VARCHAR(100),
district VARCHAR(50),
gender enum ('M','F','O'),
dob date,
total_fee float,
paid_fee float
);
*****************
To Delete Table:

DROP TABLE <table_name>
Example: DROP TABLE student;

*************************
To insert Data in table

INSERT INTO <table_name> (colname1,colname2.....) VALUES(colname1value,colnamevalue2.....)
For example:
INSERT INTO student (id,name,district,gender,dob,total_fee,paid_fee) VALUES(1,'Ram sharma','kathmandu','M','2000-12-02',60000,40000);

************************
To view different Data in table using distinct statement

SELECT DISTINCT <data_name> FROM <table_name>;
For example:  SELECT DISTINCT district FROM student;

***********************
To Delete data from table

DELETE FROM <table_name> Where condition
for example
DELETE FROM student WHERE id=1;

******************
To update data in table

UPDATE <table_name> SET columnname=value WHERE condition;
UPDATE student SET district=kathmandu,id=3 WHERE name='Ramu sharma';


************************
Where clause:

SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>
SELECT * FROM student WHERE gender='M'; 

*******************
AND operator : All condition must be true.
For example:
SELECT * FROM student WHERE gender='M' and district='kathmandu';
*********************
OR operator: if any one condition is true

SELECT * FROM student WHERE gender='M' or paid_fee>10000;
**********************

IN Operator

SELECT * FROM student WHERE district IN('kathmandu','lalitpur');
***********************
NOT IN operator

SELECT * FROM student WHERE district NOT IN('kathmandu','lalitpur');

*****************
NULL/EMpty-- NUll means nothing ////empty is value with 0 length
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name IS NULL
*****************

Data is ascending and descending order

SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY name ASC;------ this is for ascending order
SELECR * FROM student ORDER BY name DESC;------- this is for descending order

***********************
MIN, MAX, AVG

SELECT MIN(paid_fee) From student;
SELECT MAX(paid_fee) From student;
SELECT AVG(paid_fee) From student;

**************************
LIMIT 

SELECT * FROM student limit 2;
SELECT * FROM student limit 1,3;

*************************
Search in SQL
LIKE Operator
it helps to search the data

wildcard
a. % --it represent any text
b. _ -- it represent single character
for example: name start with R
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'R%';
example: name end with m 
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE '%m'; 

use of _

SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'Ra_';

mixig both:
SELECT * FROM student WHERE name LIKE 'R_%'
